# Hi there!!! This is I am working on

I'm curretly learning about <i>Node.JS</i>. So this repository will be used to make some link about learning this framework. Feel free to take some examples or code line (hahaha) and make feedbacks to enhence this trip.</p> 

<p>
  These are some ideas it may help you:
  <ul>
      <li>Create a new NodeJS project.</li>
      <li>Use express.js that will help us to create our Web Server.</li>
      <li>Create a good structure of our project.</li>
      <li>Create an Api Rest.</li>
      <li>Create and Connect to a database.</li>
      <li>Do you want to make a WebPage? We use a React library to make our first webpage.</li>
      <li>Doing it again, however, this time we will make it using TypeScript.</li>
  </ul>
